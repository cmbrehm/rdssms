<div align="left">Before you start the workshop, you need to setup some resources on AWS for the hands-on labs. This section describes the steps to provision the AWS resources that are required.</div>

* If you are running this workshop in an AWS-sponsored or AWS-staffed event, it is likely that you are given a temporary AWS account environment. You need to follow the instructions on [Sign in: from an AWS Event](lab0/1_sigin_ee.html) section.

* If you are running this workshop in your own AWS account, or you are advised by AWS staff to configure the workshop environment manually, you need to follow the instructions on [Sign in: Regular AWS Account](lab0/1_signin.html) section.
